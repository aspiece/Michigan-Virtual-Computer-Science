This repositiry is where Andrew Spiece releases resources for students in his computer science courses at Michigan Virtual. It is displayed for the students using Github pages using a Jekyll template. All of the Markdoan files are located and edited in the gh-pages branch.

## Issues and pull requests

Feel free to submit an issue or a pull request for anything you feel needs to be added for students in my computer science classes.

These resources are free to use in your courses as well. It's simply a repository of resources that you may find useful in your classroom.
